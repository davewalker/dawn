    <p>I am a victim of needing to ‘see’ the idea in order to ‘think’ the idea;
    always the ‘visualiser’, never the ‘theoriser’.</p>
    <p>Holistic creativity comes naturally to me, I’ve never really been
    conceptually driven. I have an idea, I make it — it’s as simple as that!
    However, over the years I’ve found myself shifting solely from creating the
    aesthetically pleasing to questioning everything behind the surface design —
    ‘why am I creating this?’, ‘what purpose does it serve?’ and so on.</p>
